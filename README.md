# `#OLL` ("Hash OLL") Naming

Benefits:

- Can be learned in minutes.
- Easily written in a table.
- Provides standard angles for non-symmetric cases.
- `#` to indicate an OLL
  - The `#` looks like the grid separating stickers on U, and OLL is about getting all those stickers the right color (i.e. forming that grid)
  - Usable for hashtags in various platforms.
- Naming scheme:
  - All letters.
  - "O" for "oriented", reminiscent of 0 (zero, i.e. "nothing to orient").
  - Corner orientation letters based on shape.
  - Edge orientation based on the sides with edges that need to be solved. (The table here uses U side edge order matching the Reid spec — F, R, L, B — used by ACube and other software.)

Caveats:

- Most OLLs have two synonyms. This means that people and software must be aware of the alternatives when indexing `#OLL` cases.
- One CO name (S) matches an existing move name. This means that most of the corresponding `#OLL` cases consist entirely of valid moves, if not written in hash form.
- `#PBL` conficts with a hashtag for a common [2x2x2 step](https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/PBL).
